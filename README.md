# Jean's Equation
Jeans_Solver: Providing the ODE (Jean's Equation) and relevant constant, numerically solves the ODE and returns $\rho$ as a function or $r$.
f: You need to specify your PDE here. For 2nd order PDEs, you need to split into two first-order PDEs. 
I only plotted the two solution using different parameters.
# Todos:
Jeans.py: I think I got the general idea of solving Jean's Equation under spherical symmetry and quasi-equilibrium assumptions. However, I am having trouble understanding how they got from the ODE to the solution using the constants they provided.
